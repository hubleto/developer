# Add route, controller and view for managing contacts

We want to render table and form for our addressbook.

In the previous tutorial we created a model for contacts but did not create a user interface to manage it. In this tutorial, we will learn how to add **route, controller and view** to manage our contacts.

> **IMPORTANT** | To understand the basics of creating routes, controllers and views, check [this previous tutorial](add-route-controller-and-view).

## Add new route

Add following line anywhere in the `init()` method of your app's `Loader.php`:

###### ./apps/custom/MyApp/Loader.php
```php
<?php
namespace HubletoApp\Custom\MyApp;
class Loader extends \HubletoMain\Core\App {
  public function init(): void {
    ...
    $this->main->router->httpGet([ '/^my-app\/contacts\/?$/' => Controllers\Contacts::class ]);
    ...
  }
}
```

## Create controller

Create following controller in `./apps/custom/MyApp/Controllers/Contacts.php`:

###### ./apps/custom/MyApp/Controllers/Contacts.php
```php
<?php
namespace HubletoApp\Custom\MyApp\Controllers;
class Contacts extends \HubletoMain\Core\Controller {
  public function prepareView(): void {
    parent::prepareView();
    $this->setView('@HubletoApp:External:MyCompany:MyApp/Contacts.twig');
  }
}
```

## Create view

Create following view in `./apps/custom/MyApp/Views/Contacts.twig`:

###### ./apps/custom/MyApp/Views/Contacts.twig**
```php
<app-table string:model="HubletoApp/custom/MyApp/Models/Contact"></app-table>
```

> **NOTE** Hubleto uses `<app-*` HTML notation to insert React components into the browser's DOM.

## Add a button in the dashboard

Last step is to publish your new addressbook. Modify `Dashboard.twig` file to look like this:

```html
<div class="mt-2">
  <a class="btn btn-primary" href="my-app/contacts">
    <span class="icon"><i class="fas fa-user"></i></span>
    <span class="text">{{ '{{' }} translate("Contacts") {{ '}}' }}</span>
  </a>
</div>
```

## Your addressbook is ready

Now open Hubleto in your browser, go to your app and then click `Contacts`. Enjoy your new addressbook ðŸ˜œ. If you like Hubleto, [help us improve](../improve) it.
