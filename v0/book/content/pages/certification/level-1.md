  * Optionally, junior level of React / Typescript \- this is required only if a developer is going to implement react-based functionality.
  * Experience with `composer` \- PHP’s package manager and `npm` \- Javascript’s package manager.
  * Experience with setting up a local development environment \- a webserver (Apache or Nginx) with PHP and SQL database (MariaDB or MySQL).

Having this knowledge, a developer shall be able to configure his local development environment as described in [https://developer.hubleto.com/v0/getting-started](https://developer.hubleto.com/v0/getting-started). This will be required to work on some tasks of the certification process.
