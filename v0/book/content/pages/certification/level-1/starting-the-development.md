# Lesson 2: Starting the development

## Prepare development environment

Follow steps in [installation guide](../../installation) to prepare your development environment. For this lessons, you will need to install only **production-ready envrionment**.

In this setup, you will be creating [custom Hubleto Apps](../../apps).

## Configuration of Hubleto

During the development and learning process, you might need to re-install your Hubleto many times. To save your time learn about [installation configuration file](../../installation/init-config).

If you get familiar with this file, do following in your project folder as an excercise:

  1. Create a `my-hubleto-init.yaml` file.
  2. Run `php hubleto init my-hubleto-init.yaml` command.

If you did everything properly, your Hubleto will be re-installed without any prompt.

## Accessing Hubleto

Once installed, your Hubleto will be available on the `projectUrl` configured in your installation configuration file.

In this lessons, we will use `http://localhost/hubleto`.

## Command-line CLI agent

Get familiar with Hubleto's [CLI agent](../../cli-agent). It provides a lot of interesting functionality to speed up your development.

For now, it is enough to read about available commands, you do not need to try them out.

## Conclusion

If you did everything properly, you should:

  * have your Hubleto installed and accessible at `http://localhost/hubleto`
  * be familiar with installation configuration file
  * be familiar with CLI agent.

It's time to proceed to the next lesson.
