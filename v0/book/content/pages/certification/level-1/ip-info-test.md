App functions:

1.  Obtain an IP address from the user for which they want to retrieve detailed information.
2.  Retrieve information about the IP address from any public external API.
3.  Display the retrieved information to the user in a clear format.
4.  Allow the user to save the retrieved information to a list of favorite IP addresses (a custom model must be created).
5.  Allow the user to browse the list of favorite IP addresses, including the saved information.

*Bonus #1: For the last point, use the React components Table and Form. (examples of use are in the Hubleto ERP source code)*

*Bonus #2: Display statistics of the favorite IP addresses, e.g., the count of IP addresses based on their timezone.*
