Hi developer.

My name is Dusan and in this tutorial I will show you how to download and install Hubleto to your computer.

First, I'd like to introduce Hubleto and explain what you need to run it.

Hubleto is an **open-source platform for creating data-management apps** like those you often use in CRMs or ERPs. It comes with a ready-to-use set of applications so that you won't need to start developement from scratch. For example, by default it contains apps like `contacts`, `calendar`, `lead management` or `deal management`.

It also provides a built-in functionallity for **settings**, **reporting** or **user and permission management**.

Hubleto will significantly shorten time needed to develop and deploy your work.

Hubleto is a PHP/SQL-based platform. To run in, you'll need only **PHP**, **SQL database engine** (e.g., MariaDB or MySQL) and a **webserver** (e.g. Apache or Nginx).

So, let's download and install. First, we need to open the Hubleto website https://www.hubleto.com, then go to `Download` section and click `Download the latest release` button. This will download a small .zip package containig Hubleto core and required 3rd-party libraries.

Unzip this file to any folder under your webserver's DocumentRoot. For example, if you are a Linux user, it may be `/var/www/html/my-hubleto`.

Once unpacked, go to this folder in terminal, run `php hubleto init` command and follow the instructions on the screen. Let's show this by an example.
