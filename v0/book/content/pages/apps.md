| **Custom apps**     | `\HubletoApp\Custom`     | Use custom apps if you are developing a custom project and do not plan to re-use your app elsewhere. |
| **External apps**   | `\HubletoApp\External`   | External apps are developed by external companies and are planned to be re-used in many projects.    |

## Create app with CLI agent

Creating a new app is very easy. For example, to create an app that will be used in your project, simply run following code in your terminal (you must be inside a Hubleto project root folder):

```bash
php hubleto app create HubletoApp\Custom\MyFirstApp
```
