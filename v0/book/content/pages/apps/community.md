# Community apps

Apps freely available for your commercial projects.

Community apps are those aps which are freely available in the Hubleto's GitHub repository. You may use them for your commercial projects for free, without any hidden costs. Simply [install](../installation) Hubleto to your computer or server and enjoy.

Full list of the apps is available directly on GitHub at https://github.com/hubleto/erp/tree/main/apps. This repository also serves as an important documentation and set of example about how Hubleto apps are structured and developed.

We encourage you to dive deep into the codebase and learn the principles of Hubleto development by examples.

You may also read the [source code documentation](../source-code) to get familiar with features and API of these apps.
